CREATING DASHBOARD: Created 3 bar charts for Sales by Category,Sub-Category and Ship Mode. An Area chart is created to show sales of 2 years viz. 2019 and 2020. Area Chart was created for Monthly Sales by YoY and Monthly Profits by YoY. Map was also added and 5 sub regions viz. East, West, North,South and Central were created using slicer. Donut Chart was created to compare Sales with Segment and Payment Mode.

INSIGHTS: Sales in March, October and December months were low even then profit was quite high. In Sub-Category, Phones were most sold out followed by Chairs and Binders. During Payment, most customers prefer COD followed by Online methods and Cards.

Forecasting: Forecasting is done using Line Chart and done on Time-Series. Using DAX Queries, we can create table by performing aggregation on Time Series.
